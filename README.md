[Perth Hospital ](https://github.com/BillHuynh/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/Projects/Perth%20Hospital)
Obtained weather data from the NCDC to be used to model Emergency Demand. Dataset was cleaned/wrangled  API packages in R was used to model demand. Data was cleaned and APIs were used to source the data.


[Exploratory Data Analysis of patients with risk of Heart Problems](https://github.com/BillHuynh/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/Projects/Heart%20Attack)

According to World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year and affecting the quality of life of a large number of people worldwide. Prerequisites of the treatment of these types of disease involve proper diagnosis method to identify its occurrence and its type.

Dataset description: Dataset contains different features along with the disease state. It contains total 13 features and an additional disease state, in total 14 columns. It contains different types of data including int, float and string. Feature names, data type and values are described in the following section with their proper unit details. Data may contain 'null' or 'nan' values. Each observation is a datapoint along the row of the dataset. Patient and observation areused interchangeably in this case.

[Data Analysis and ML Prediction of Obesity](https://github.com/BillHuynh/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/Projects/Perth%20Hospital)

Obesity has become a global epidemic that has doubled since 1980, with serious consequences for health in children, teenagers, and adults. Obesity levels in individuals may relate to their eating habits and physical condition. In this assessment, you will be analysing and creating ML models based on a given dataset that contains attributes of individuals with relation to obesity levels. This dataset include data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals based on their
eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records.




[Survival prediction of patients with heart failure](https://github.com/BillHuynh/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/Projects/Research%20paper)

The authors have developed ten ML models for predicting survival of patients with heart failure and compared their performance.The dataset contains the medical records of patients who had heart failure, collected during their follow-up period. Each patient profile has 13 clinical features. Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year, and they mainly exhibit as myocardial infarctions and heart failures. Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart cannot pump enoughblood to meet the needs of the body. Machine learning, in particular, can predict patientsâ€™ survival from their data and can
individuate the most important features among those included in their medical records.
